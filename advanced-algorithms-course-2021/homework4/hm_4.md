### Homework 4

1) A = [[3], [5, 8], [9, 2, 6], [4, 7, 3, 1]],
   Path output: [Left, Left, Right].  
   Not sure what is meant by 
   optimization, if it means that a computer scientist can use
   this algorithm instead of manual path computation, in this case
   it optimizes developer's lifetime and makes his life less depressive.
   This algorithm computes the most expensive path from a top to a bottom.
   
2)  For the top element we don't need to computer path
    complexity because the top represents the only a 
    single element.
